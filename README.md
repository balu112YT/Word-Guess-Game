Word Guess Game (Hangman) - MIT License

Doesn't require any special tool.
Requires Java 8+ to run.

A simple **Word Guess Game** in Java where the player guesses a hidden word letter by letter. Some words may contain spaces. Each wrong guess draws a part of the hangman, and the player has a limited number of lives.

- Random word selection from a predefined list
- Only allows English letters (A-Z) as input
- Prevents repeated guesses of the same letter
- Reveals spaces automatically in the word
- Visual ASCII hangman drawing updates with each wrong guess
- Tracks lives and ends the game if they reach zero
- Option to replay the game after winning or losing

How to Play

1. Run the Java program.
2. The game will display the length of the word and your remaining lives.
3. Guess one letter at a time.
4. Correct guesses reveal letters in the word.
5. Wrong guesses reduce your lives and draw a new part of the hangman.
6. The game ends if:
   - You guess the word correctly
   - You run out of lives
7. After the game ends, you can choose to replay.
